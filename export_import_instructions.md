Data Export and Import Instructions
Fit in IQHSB uses your browser's local storage to save all your data. This means your data is only on the device you're using. These instructions will help you back up or move your data.

Exporting Your Data
Go to the History page.

Click the "Export All Plans as JSON" button.

A file named fit_iqhsb_data.json will be downloaded. This file contains all your saved profile and plan data.

Store this file in a safe place, like on your cloud storage (Google Drive, iCloud, etc.) or a USB drive.

Importing Your Data
WARNING: Importing will overwrite your current data on this device. Be sure you want to replace everything.

Go to the History page.

Click the "Import JSON" button.

A file selection dialog will appear.

Select the fit_iqhsb_data.json file you previously exported.

Your data will be loaded into the app, replacing any existing information.

Note on Security: Since this is a prototype, data is not encrypted. For a production version, we would implement secure server-side storage and user authentication.
